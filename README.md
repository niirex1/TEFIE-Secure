# TEFIE-Secure: Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection

TEFIE-Secure is a state-of-the-art framework designed for the detection of vulnerabilities in smart contracts. By leveraging advanced techniques such as Figurative Learning, Incremental Transfer Learning (ITL), and Ensemble Classification, TEFIE-Secure provides unparalleled accuracy and efficiency in identifying potential vulnerabilities.

## Key Features:

- **Unified Framework**: TEFIE-Secure offers a comprehensive solution that integrates smart contract vulnerability detection and specification.
  
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Incorporates ITL, Ensemble techniques, and Figurative Learning to enhance vulnerability detection in real-time.
  
- **High Precision**: Empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior precision and computational efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art systems.

## Repository Contents:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization of smart contract source code, caching, and batching for GloVe and BERT embeddings.

2. **Feature Selection with Figurative Learning**: Incorporates Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Linear SVM, Sparse Graph Construction with Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Symbolic Regression for feature selection.

3. **Vulnerability Detection using Ensemble Classification**: Uses Incremental Transfer Learning (ITL) with ResNet-50 and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for vulnerability classification. The predictions from both models are integrated using weighted averaging.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- R (version 3.6.0 or higher)
- RStudio (optional, but recommended for a better R coding experience)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/TEFIE-Secure.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   install.packages(c("keras", "e1071"))
   ```

3. Navigate to the repository and run the main script:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/niirex1/TEFIE-Secure
   ```

## Usage:

1. Load your smart contract source code.
2. Run the data preprocessing script to obtain the concatenated embeddings.
3. Use the feature selection script to refine the features for vulnerability detection.
4. Run the vulnerability detection script to classify vulnerabilities.

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing bugs, improving documentation, or proposing new features, your efforts and expertise are appreciated. Here's how you can contribute:

### 1. **Fork the Repository**

Start by forking the [TEFIE-Secure repository(https://github.com/your_username/TEFIE-Secure)].

### 2. **Clone Your Fork**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/TEFIE-Secure.git
cd TEFIE-Secure
```

### 3. **Create a New Branch**

It's best practice to create a new branch for each feature or fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your_feature_name
```
or
```bash
git checkout -b fix/your_fix_name
```

### 4. **Make Your Changes**

- Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards.
- If you're adding a feature, make sure to also add relevant tests and documentation.
- If you're fixing a bug, ensure the bug is reproducible with a test before you fix it.

### 5. **Commit Your Changes**

Keep your commit messages clear and descriptive:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add a brief description of your changes"
```

### 6. **Push to Your Fork**

```bash
git push origin feature/your_feature_name
```

### 7. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**

Go to your fork on GitHub and click the **"New pull request"** button. Fill in the necessary details and submit.

### 8. **Address Review Comments**

Maintainers will review your PR. Address any comments or feedback they provide to ensure timely merging of your contributions.

### Additional Guidelines:

- **Issue First**: For significant changes, it's best to open an issue for discussion before diving into coding.
- **Stay Updated**: Ensure your fork is always updated with the main branch to avoid merge conflicts.
- **Documentation**: Update the README or other documentation if necessary.
- **Testing**: Ensure your code passes all tests and doesn't introduce new bugs.
- **Respect Code Style**: Follow the coding style and conventions used throughout the project.
