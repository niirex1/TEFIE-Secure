  # Assuming you have a distance matrix dist_matrix for the embeddings

  # Figurative Learning with Symbolic Regression
  # Placeholder for symbolic regression and Bayesian optimization
  # You'll need to integrate actual implementations for these steps

  # Handling Complex Multi-contract Interactions with Simplified GNN
  # Placeholder for GCN and max-pooling
  # You'll need to integrate actual implementations for these steps

# Example Usage
# embeddings <- matrix(runif(1000), ncol=100) # Random embeddings for testing
# y <- sample(0:1, 10, replace = TRUE) # Random labels for testing
# selected_features <- tefie_secure_feature_selection(embeddings, y)
